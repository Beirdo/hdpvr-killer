You will need to install the headers (and library) for libftdi.  Under Ubuntu
or Debian:
  apt-get install libftdi-dev

Run make, then sudo make install.  This will install into /usr/local/bin, and
put the chipid config file in /etc.

You need to make sure that the ftdi_sio driver has not claimed this particular
device.  There may be a nice way to do it only for a particular instance, but
I do not know of one, so what I have done is to blacklist the ftdi_sio driver
completely on my backend system.  This obviously will not be too useful if you
have other ftdi serial devices on that machine.  To do this, copy the
blacklist-ftdi_sio.conf file into /etc/modprobe.d/ (or the equivalent) before
plugging in the device.

Plug your device into an available USB port :)

After this, run ftdi-probe to get the serial number.  Please be sure to find
one that matches the pattern of:

For testing, you can do:

hdpvr-power SERIAL# off
then
hdpvr-power SERIAL# on

Of course, put in your serial number from the output above (in my case above
it would be GHUD9O5F).

Finally, you can use the find-zero-byte.pl with mythtv to catch the zero byte
files and power cycle the HDPVR.  You will need to edit it to change the 
%hdpvrs hash to contain your HDPVR devices and the corresponding serial number 
for the device that will power cycle each.  The cardids can be found in mythweb
on the status page.

The find-zero-byte.pl script is designed to be run by the backend as an event 
script triggered by the "EventCmdRecStarted" event with the parameters:
/usr/local/bin/find-zero-byte.pl %CARDID% %CHANID% %STARTTIMEISO%

Also, you should run it on the "EventCmdRecFinished" event with the parameters:
/usr/local/bin/find-zero-byte.pl %CARDID% %CHANID% %STARTTIMEISO% cancel
